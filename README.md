- When creating issues, be thoughtful and descriptive. There is a sweet spot between too brief and too verbose that should be strived for.

- Ensure that an issue does not already exist pertaining to what you are submitting. Duplicate issues will be closed.

- Be courteous in your communication. Do not harass, spam, or otherwise be disrespectful or inappropriate.
