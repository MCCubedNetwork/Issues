# Issues
This is a public issue tracker for bugs and feature suggestions related to the MC³ Network.

### Important:
If you find an exploit or vulnerability in our system, please follow these steps:
1. Privately contact our staff team about the problem.
2. **Do not** publicly release information about the issue immediately. Give us time to respond and address the issue before you spread said vulnerability publicly.

## Submitting
Issues can be submitted at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/MCCubedNetwork/Issues/issues).

### Do:
- Follow the formatting guide below.
- Check that your issue is not a duplicate of an existing issue.
- Verify your issue as an actual issue.
- Take advantage of [GitHub's markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github), it makes it easier to read your message.

### Do not:
- Bump issues to receive a response.
- Argue unproductively, always be reasonable.
- Re-create an issue you feel was closed incorrectly.
- Add useless comments like 👍, +1 or "I like this idea"
- Create disrespectful or provocative comments.

## Formatting

### Title

**Example:**
